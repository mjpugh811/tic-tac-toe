# tic-tac-toe
A simple tic-tac-toe game.

This is the react code for a tic-tac-toe tutorial.  This is not my original code, however, I have entered it here to demonstrate that this is code that I am able to understand.  I have also been able to implement it correctly, both in the browser and locally on my PC.  For the PC version, I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE.
